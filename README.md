# Activities and Modules Completed

## 1. Intro to HTML and CSS
In the course, I worked with HTML and CSS to create webpages this recipe book was created using the list notations as well as using
Images found online.

## 2. Intro to JavaScript
In the course, I practiced and worked with code written in JavaScript This includes For loops, While loops, If statements, objects and 
object inheritance. More info in the JS Repository. The example being shown was done using functions and the various shape code thatâ€™s in JavaScript used to create Kirby.

## 3. Natural Simulations
In the course, I worked with more advanced functions and objects from javascript that is used to simulate real life in a digital environment.This mountain Range was created by using noise, a function in Javascript used to create a unique set of random numbers from 0 to 1

## 4. Dan Shiffman's Coding Challenge 
Our main summative in this course was to recreate a Dan Shiffman coding challenge video in a classroom environment. We were required to be able to talk through the challenge, engage the class and be able to help other classmates.

## Languages I've learned so Far:

  - Turing: The first ever language I learned in the Computer Science course. Turing acted as the beginning stepping stones towards learning more complicated and more useful coding languages in the future.
  
  - Action Script: My first introduction to a more intneractive coding language. Action Script allowed me to create movement and use objects and assign code to them.
  
  - C++: A more text based language that I learned after Action Script. C++ allowed me to work with the usual for loops and while loops and introduced me to functions and arrays in the coding environment. I created small programs like calculators and a Tamadachi style game for the big project [HERE](https://github.com/Bunnymisu/C-Summative-Project-2017)
  
  - JavaScript: The proper introduction to objet oriented coding. From this, I learned about Object inheritance and how to create designs and make moving/interactable elements in programs as well as how to code websites using HTML and CSS.
  
## My Future Plan and Goals
For my Post Secondary education, I plan on pursuing a degree in technology, specifically computer science and becoming a software engineer. As a pass time, I am currently trying to learn other coding languages that was not learned in the Computer Science classes like C# or Python to improve my coding language library. I use older languages that I've learned like C++ to create small little projects to help me retain my knowledge of the language as well as how certain functions works. My goal is to program a small, functioning game before I graduate from University as a way of exercising my coding skills and to properly understand the coding environment and to work on my problem solving skills before I move on into the professional field. It's also fun to have something to show for when creating a portfolio.

## Free Code Camp Plans
After the course, I want to learn more about JavaScript because I had trouble completely grasping JavaScript solely using Khan Academy. Object-oriented coding is important for my future as my the career that I plan on persueing requires this skill. I beleive that Code Camp can also be a good gateway into other coding languages with their tutorials and guidance on other languages.
